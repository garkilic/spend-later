## Accessibility Updates

- **Hint**: "Opens form to log a purchase you're considering"

### Hero Card
- **Label**: "Willpower wins, saved this month: $1,234.56"
- Maintained existing tap gesture for graph

---

## Design Rationale

### Text Layout
The new vertical layout follows standard financial app patterns:
- Label at top
- Large number in focus
- Context below

### Button Text
"Log a Potential Purchase" is:
- More natural language
- Reflects user intent
- Less judgmental than "resisted"

### Default Tab
Dashboard as default ensures:
- Users see their progress immediately
- Consistent entry point
- Main stats always visible on launch

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Consider removing tax entirely from backend**
   - If UI removed, may want to clean up ViewModel
   - Remove taxRatePercent bindings if unused

2. **Test tab persistence**
   - Verify tab doesn't persist between sessions
   - Always starts fresh on Dashboard

3. **User flow testing**
   - Test complete user journey
   - Verify all entry points lead to Dashboard
